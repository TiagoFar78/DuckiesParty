# Objective
Avoid drawing an *Killer Duckie* and be the last player remaining. Drawing an *Killer Duckie* without a *Angel Duckie* card leads to elimination!

# Turn Structure

On each player’s turn, they can:

1. Use Action Cards:
   - Players may play any number of action cards before drawing a card from the deck.
   
2. Draw a Card:
   - Players end their turn by drawing a card from the draw pile.
   - If they draw a *Killer Duckie* and cannot use a *Angel Duckie*, they are eliminated.

# Cards Description

### *Killer Duckie*

Drawn card that eliminates the player unless they have a *Angel Duckie* card.

### *Angel Duckie*

Can be played immediately after drawing an *Killer Duckie* to avoid elimination. After being saved, the *Killer Duckie* is placed back into the deck secretly at any position chosen by the player.

### *Rude Duckie*

Ends the current player’s turn, without drawing a new card, and forces the next player to take two turns in a row.

### *Dodge Duckie*

Ends the player’s turn immediately without drawing a card.

### *Begger Duckie*

The player asks another player to give them one card. The chosen player decides which card to give.

### *Shuffle Duckie*

Shuffles the draw pile. The order is random and the player who used the card can't view the cards in the pile.

### *Seer Duckie*

Allows a player to privately view the top 3 cards of the draw pile.

### *Cancel Duckie*

Cancels the effect of any card except an *Killer Duckie* or a *Angel Duckie*. Can be used anytime, even outside the player’s turn.

This card can be played after another *Cancel Duckie* has been played and keep the effects. This can stack while players have *Cancel Duckie* cards to play.

# Setup and Starting the Game

1. Give each player 1 *Angel Duckie* card to start.
2. Remove all *Killer Duckie* cards from the deck.
3. Shuffle the remaining deck and deal 7 cards face-down to each player.
4. After each player has their starting hand, shuffle back into the deck a number of *Killer Duckie* cards equal to the number of players minus one. This ensures that only one player will avoid being killed and win the game.
5. Randomly choose a player to start.
6. Choose a random player order. This ensures that players play after and before someone random every game instance and not the same people everytime.
